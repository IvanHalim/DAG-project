    "\"A picture speaks a thousand words\" is one of the most commonly used phrases. But a graph speaks so much more than that. A visual representation of data, in the form of graphs, helps us gain actionable insights and make better decisions based on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at a simple graph to understand the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='files/img/simple.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that this graph represents the places in a city that people generally visit, and the path that was followed by a visitor of that city. Let us consider V as the places and E as the path to travel from one place to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$$\n",
    "$$E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_5), (v_5, v_5), (v_4, v_5), (v_4, v_4)\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The edge $(u, v)$ is the same as the edge $(v, u)$ - They are unordered pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely - __Graphs are mathematical structures used to study pairwise relationships between objects and entities.__ It is a branch of Discrete Mathematics and has found multiple applications in Computer Science, Chemistry, Linguistics, Operations Research, Sociology, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally,\n",
    "-  A __Graph__ is a pair of sets. $G = (V, E)$. $V$ is the set of vertices. $E$ is a set of edges. $E$ is made up of pairs of elements from $V$ (unordered pair)\n",
    "-  A __Directed Graph__ is also a pair of sets. $D = (V, A)$. $V$ is the set of vertices. $A$ is the set of arcs. $A$ is made up of pairs of elements from $V$ (ordered pair)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of directed graphs, there is a distinction between $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$. Usually the edges are called arcs in such cases to indicate a notion of direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are packages that exist in R and Python to analyze data using Graphs. In this article we will be using Networkx Python package.\n",

    "From the above examples it is clear that the applications of Graphs are numerous and vast. Let us look at a few use cases:\n",
    "-  __Marketing Analytics__ - Graphs can be used to figure out the most influential people in a Social Network. Advertisers and Marketers can estimate the biggest bang for the marketing buck by routing their message through the most influential people in a Social Network.\n",
    "-  __Banking Transactions__ - Graphs can be used to find unusual patterns helping in mitigating Fraudulent transactions. There have been examples where Terrorist activity has been detected by analyzing the flow of money across interconnected Banking networks.\n",
    "-  __Supply Chain__ - Graphs help in identifying optimum routes for your delivery trucks and in identifying locations for warehouses and delivery centres.\n",
    "-  __Pharma__ - Pharma companies can optimize the routes of the salesman using Graph theory. This helps in cutting costs and reducing the travel time for salesman.\n",
    "-  __Telecom__ - Telecom companies typically use Graphs (Voronoi diagrams) to understand the quantity and location of Cell towers to ensure maximum coverage.\n",
